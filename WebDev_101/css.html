                <h2>Content</h2>
                <p class="content">Today I would like to talk about something that becomes an essential part of our day-to-day routine - the
                web and how to create a website. I believe many of us were buying some product online, ordering some service,
                or just looking up a piece of information. Some
                of us could be a business owner and again to reach out to the costumers it would be beneficial to
                be online present.</p>
                <br>
                <figure>
                    <img src="image/Logo CSS3.JPG" alt="image">
                    <figcaption>Are we living in a simulation?</figcaption>
                </figure>
                     
                <p class="content">So, what is the recipe for creating a website? First and foremost, lets us answer the question “what is the 
                 internet?”. According to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet" target="_blank"> Wikipedia</a> website “the internet is the global system of interconnected computer
                networks that uses the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to communicate between networks and devices”. 
                 Furthermore, if one wishes to have a website then it requires a domain name which will be an address on the 
                 internet. There are plenty of providers where you can buy one,
                 also those companies provide hosting service. The next step is to choose technologies and tools, and here
                 all depends on the aim of the website. The first way is creating it from scratch and for that, you at least
                need to know programming languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript which are the pillars of the web per se. It 
                  is not necessary to go to a university to learn all this. There are plenty of free sources and the IT
                  community is vast, friendly, and supportive. I would like to highlight one sufficient source, it is 
                 <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank"> w3school.com</a> which is free training website for learning web
                 technologies online.

                 Besides the certificate which you can claim after completing the course, you can start applying for a modern 
                 job as a web developer. However, if all this sound too complicated and you just want to set up quickly a
                  web page for your small business than there is good news for you. In the past few years were created many
                 CMS's (Content Management System's) like WordPress, Wix, etc which allowed to set up a web page without
                  any bits of knowledge in coding. After a few hours of a tutorial, you will be able to create a nice,
                  responsive website which will be tailored for your business needs.</p>
                 <p class="content">In the end, I would like to say that ether way of creating a web site could be challenging but it also
                      could be very rewarding and 
                 satisfying to see your creation online.
